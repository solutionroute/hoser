# hoser
Simple user and user rights management - a Go package

`hoser` impelements a Bolthold (BoltDB) backed implementation of a User
interface and a to-be growing variety of tools.

## What's a "hoser"?

Clearly system users are not "lusers" but a hoser is akin to that. All in fun
and if you don't like it, take off, eh?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_and_Doug_McKenzie) provides some
background; [this CBC
article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/how-s-it-going-eh-bob-and-doug-mckenzie-help-raise-325k-in-special-show-1.4210544)
has a worthwhile quote:

> The Bob and Doug bit started out in the 1980s as a bit of a rebellion against
> a network order to include more Canadian content, but ended up becoming
> a pop-culture sensation  ensuring "eh" entered the Canadian lexicon.  
>
> For that, Thomas is sorry.  
> 
> "I apologize to the country, to everyone individually in Canada," Thomas said
> with a laugh. "I'm so sorry we brought hosers and 'take off' into the
> linguistic compendium of Canada."
